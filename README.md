# chess-game
A chess game that exemplifies OOP by creating classes that are well encapsulated and polymorphic as well as inheriting from other classes.

Requires two players, starts with player one (bottom of board) who selects a square using chess square notation - eg. type e2 to select the pawn on e2.  Then choose a square to move to, the program will list available moves.  Type undo to undo the last move made.
