# chess-game
A chess game that exemplifies OOP by creating classes that are well encapsulated and polymorphic as well as inheriting from other classes.

Requires two players, starts with player one (white pieces).  Click on a square to select a piece and squares that are legal moves for that piece are highlighted.  Click on the same piece (or a non-legal move) to de-select current piece and choose a different one.
